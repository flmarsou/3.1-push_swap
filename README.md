# ü¶ä What is Push Swap?

A sorting algorithm program that sorts a random amount of integers with a handful of different possible moves, using two different stacks (A and B).

### Overview:
- **Parsing:** The first step is to check the provided arguments to ensure they are integers. This is crucial to avoid any erroneous inputs.
- **Storing:** Each integer is converted into a **node structure**, ready for manipulation and sorting.
- **Sorting:** Depending on the amount of integers to sort, different algorithm functions are called (**Simple Sort** or **Radix Sort**).

### Radix Sort:
- **Indexing:** To utilize the Radix Sort, each integers is assigned an **ascending index** starting from 0 for the lowest value, increasing incrementally to the highest value. This indexing **transforms potentially large numbers into smaller**, manageable indices.
- **Bit Shifting:** Radix Sort utilizes **bit shifting** to separate indexes into two groups (0 and 1) for each bit position. This process is repeated until all indexes have been sorted.

# ‚öíÔ∏è Compilation

1. Run `make` to compile the program.
2. Run `make re` to recompile everything.
3. Run `./push_swap <args>` to execute the program.

### Rules for `<args>`:
- Needs more than one argument.
- Can only contain integers.
- Can't have duplicates.
- Needs to be between -2147483648 and 2147483647.

### Commands:
```sh
./push_swap "69 42 777 420 23"
```
```sh
./push_swap 69 42 777 420 23
```
```sh
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l‚Äé
```
```sh
ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_linux $ARG
```

# üßº Cleaning

1. Run `make clean` to remove every object files.
2. Run `make fclean` to remove every object files, including the executable.

# üìë List of Functions

- [x] [`main`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/main.c) - Calls and sends info to the [parser](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/parsing/parser.c) and [sorter](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/sorting/sorter.c).

## 1. Parsing

- [x] [`parser`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/parsing/parser.c) - Goes through all the arguments to see if everything can be processed further.

- [x] [`isduplicate`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/parsing/isduplicate.c) - Boolean that checks if any arg appears twice.

## 2. Stacks

- [x] [`init_stack`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/lists/init_stack.c) - Initializes a linked list named "Stack A", which stores every input.
- [x] [`init_index`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/lists/init_index.c) - Assigns an accending index to every nodes of "Stack A".

## 3. Moves

- [x] [`sa`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/lists/moves/sa.c) `Swap A` -> Swap the first 2 elements at the top of Stack A.
- [x] [`sb`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/lists/moves/sb.c) `Swap B` -> Swap the first 2 elements at the top of Stack B.
- [x] [`ss`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/lists/moves/ss.c)‚Äé -> `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
- [x] [`pa`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/lists/moves/pa.c) `Push A` -> Push the first element at the top of Stack B, and put it at the top of Stack A.
- [x] [`pb`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/lists/moves/pb.c) `Push B` -> Push the first element at the top of Stack A, and put it at the top of Stack B.
- [x] [`ra`](https://github.com/flmarsou/push_swap/blob/main/src/lists/moves/ra.c) `Rotate A` -> Shift up all elements of Stack A by 1 (the first element becomes the last one).
